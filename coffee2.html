It is believed to be the first species of coffee to have been cultivated and is currently the dominant cultivar, representing about 60% of global production. Coffee produced from the less acidic, more bitter, and more highly caffeinated robusta bean (C. canephora) makes up most of the remaining coffee production. The natural populations of Coffea Arabica are restricted to the forests of South Ethiopia and Yemen.Coffea arabica is called bÅ«nn in Arabic.</p>
